## 📌 About the Project  
**Olympinomics** is a data science project exploring how a country's **economic growth**, **population**, and **regional location** affect its **Olympic medal performance**. Inspired by a love of economics and global sports, we dive into historical Olympic data and global GDP trends to uncover what drives nations to the podium.

## 🔍 Research Questions
- Does a nation’s **GDP growth** correlate with Olympic success?
- Is **geographic region** (e.g., continent) a significant factor?
- What **socioeconomic variables** best predict medal performance?

## 📈 Key Takeaways
- A strong **positive correlation** exists between **GDP growth** and **Olympic medal counts**.
- **Regional location** showed **no statistically significant impact** via permutation testing.
- **Economic investment** in sports is a more reliable predictor of success than geography.
