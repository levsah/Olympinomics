🏅 Olympinomics
Analyzing How Economic and Geographic Factors Impact Olympic Success

📌 About the Project
Olympinomics is a data science project exploring how a country's economic growth, population, and regional location affect its Olympic medal performance. Inspired by a love of economics and global sports, we dive into historical Olympic data and global GDP trends to uncover what drives nations to the podium.

🔍 Research Questions
Does a nation’s GDP growth correlate with Olympic success?

Is geographic region (e.g., continent) a significant factor?

What socioeconomic variables best predict medal performance?

📈 Key Takeaways
A strong positive correlation exists between GDP growth and Olympic medal counts.

Regional location showed no statistically significant impact via permutation testing.

Economic investment in sports is a more reliable predictor of success than geography.
